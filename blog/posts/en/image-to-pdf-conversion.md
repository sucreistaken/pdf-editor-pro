# Image to PDF Conversion Guide

Converting images to PDF format is a frequently needed task for document sharing and archiving. Scanned documents, photographs, or screenshots can all be easily converted to professional PDF files.

## Why Convert Images to PDF?

- **Professional sharing:** PDF format displays consistently across all devices and operating systems
- **Single file convenience:** Combine dozens of images into one organized document
- **Print compatibility:** PDF preserves image quality during printing
- **Size optimization:** Combining multiple images into a single PDF can actually reduce total file size

## Converting Images with PDFEdit

The [Image to PDF](/en/img-to-pdf) converter makes the process straightforward:

1. **Upload your images:** Drag and drop your image files or use the file picker. Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats.

2. **Arrange the order:** If you uploaded multiple images, use drag-and-drop to set the desired page order.

3. **Click Convert:** A single click converts all your images into a PDF document.

4. **Download the PDF:** Your newly created PDF is ready for immediate download.

## Supported Image Formats

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| JPEG | .jpg, .jpeg | Photographs, lossy compression |
| PNG | .png | Transparent backgrounds, lossless quality |

## Tips for Best Results

### Resolution
Images should be at least 150 DPI for acceptable quality. For print use, 300 DPI is recommended. Low-resolution images may appear blurry in the final PDF.

### File Size
Each image can be up to 100 MB. For very large images, consider resizing them before conversion.

### Page Layout
Each image is placed on its own PDF page. The image dimensions are automatically adjusted to fit the page size while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

## Reverse Conversion: PDF to Images

If you need to extract images from a PDF, two tools are available:

- **[PDF to Image](/en/pdf-to-image):** Convert PDF pages to PNG, JPG, or WebP format
