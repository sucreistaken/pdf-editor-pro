# How to Merge PDF Files

Combining multiple PDF files into a single document is one of the most common PDF tasks. Whether you need to compile report sections, archive invoices, or consolidate project files, a reliable PDF merger makes the job effortless.

## Why Merge PDF Files?

Merging PDFs saves time and keeps your documents organized. Sharing a single file is far more convenient than sending multiple attachments. It also makes searching through content much faster since everything is in one place.

## How to Merge PDFs with PDFEdit

1. **Upload Your Files:** Go to the [Merge PDF](/en/merge) page. Drag and drop your PDF files or use the file picker to select them.

2. **Arrange the Order:** After uploading, drag and drop files to set the desired order. The file at the top will appear first in the final document.

3. **Click Merge:** Once the order is set, click the "Merge" button. The operation completes on our server within seconds.

4. **Download:** Your merged PDF is ready. Download it with a single click and start using it right away.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- **File size:** Each file can be up to 100 MB. For very large files, consider using the [PDF Compression](/en/compress) tool first.
- **Page orientation:** Pages with different orientations (portrait/landscape) will each maintain their original orientation in the merged document.
- **Encrypted files:** To merge encrypted PDFs, you need to [decrypt them](/en/encrypt) first.

## Custom Output Filename

PDFEdit lets you specify a custom name for the merged file. Simply enter your preferred filename before clicking Merge. If you leave it blank, the default name "merged.pdf" will be used.

## Security and Privacy

All files uploaded to PDFEdit are processed on our server and **automatically deleted within 1 hour**. Your data is never shared with third parties. The entire process is secure and private.

## Supported Formats

The PDF merger tool only accepts `.pdf` files. If you need to create a PDF from images, use our [Image to PDF](/en/img-to-pdf) converter. For HTML content, the [HTML to PDF](/en/html-to-pdf) tool is available.

## Conclusion

Merging PDF files is a simple task that takes just seconds with the right tool. PDFEdit's free merger lets you combine your documents quickly and securely. No software installation or account registration required.
