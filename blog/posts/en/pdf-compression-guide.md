# PDF Compression Guide

Large PDF files can cause serious problems with email attachments, cloud storage limits, and slow upload times. With the right compression method, you can significantly reduce your file size without sacrificing important content quality.

## Why Are PDF Files So Large?

The primary cause of large PDF files is **high-resolution images**. Scanned documents, photographs, and graphics can multiply file size dramatically. Embedded fonts, layers, and metadata also contribute to bloated files.

## Compressing PDFs with PDFEdit

Our [PDF Compression](/en/compress) tool offers three quality levels to match your needs:

### High Quality
Compresses with minimal visual quality loss. Ideal for professional documents and print-ready files. Typically achieves 20-30% size reduction.

### Medium Quality
Strikes a balance between file size and visual quality. Best for email sharing and web uploads. Achieves 40-60% size reduction on average.

### Low Quality
Applies maximum compression. Suitable for archiving or documents where only text content matters. Can achieve 60-80% reduction, though image quality may suffer.

## Compression Tips

- **Remove unnecessary pages first:** Use the [PDF Split](/en/split) tool to extract only the pages you need.
- **Optimize images beforehand:** Reduce image resolution before adding them to your PDF.
- **Clean up metadata:** Use the [Metadata Editor](/en/metadata) to strip unnecessary information.
- **Avoid re-compressing:** Compressing an already compressed file rarely yields additional savings.

## Post-Compression Quality Check

Always review your file after compression. Is the text legible? Are images clear enough? If quality does not meet your expectations, try again with a higher quality setting.

## Email Size Limits

Most email providers impose a 25 MB attachment limit. The compression tool is perfect for bringing large PDFs under this threshold. Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo all enforce approximately 25 MB limits.

## When Compression Is Not Enough

If compression alone does not reduce your file sufficiently, consider these alternatives:

- **Split the document:** Use [PDF Split](/en/split) to divide it into smaller parts.
- **Extract only text:** Use [Text Extraction](/en/extract-text) if you only need the content.
- **Remove images:** If images are not essential, extracting just the text can dramatically reduce size.

## Conclusion

PDF compression, when done correctly, can dramatically reduce file size without significant quality loss. Use PDFEdit's free compression tool to optimize your files instantly and share them with ease.
