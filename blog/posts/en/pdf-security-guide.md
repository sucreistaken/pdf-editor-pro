# PDF Security Guide

PDF files often contain sensitive information: financial reports, contracts, personal documents. Preventing unauthorized access requires proper security measures. This guide covers the essential techniques for protecting your PDF files.

## 1. PDF Encryption

The most fundamental protection method is password-protecting your files. The [PDF Encryption](/en/encrypt) tool lets you set a strong password on any PDF document.

### Encryption Levels

- **User password:** Required to open the document
- **Permission controls:** Separately control printing, copying, and editing access

### Tips for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use at least 8 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid easily guessable words like birthdays or names
- Use a different password for each file
- Consider using a password manager for tracking

## 2. Watermark Protection

[Adding watermarks](/en/watermark) is an effective deterrent against unauthorized distribution. Stamp your documents with "CONFIDENTIAL", "DRAFT", or "COPY" to emphasize the document's status and origin.

### Watermark Types

- **Text watermarks:** Words like "CONFIDENTIAL", "DRAFT", company name
- **Image watermarks:** Logo, stamp, or custom graphic

Adjust the opacity level so the watermark is visible without interfering with the document content. A 30-40% opacity typically works well.

## 3. Metadata Cleaning

PDF files contain hidden metadata: author name, creation date, software used, editing history. This information can pose privacy risks if shared with unintended recipients.

With the [Metadata Editor](/en/metadata) you can:

- View all existing metadata fields
- Edit author, title, and other fields
- Clear all metadata with a single click

## 4. Permission Settings

During PDF encryption, three important permissions can be configured:

- **Print permission:** Allow or block document printing
- **Copy permission:** Control text selection and copying
- **Edit permission:** Prevent modifications to the document

## 5. Secure Sharing Practices

- When sending an encrypted PDF, share the password through a **separate channel** (e.g., send the file via email, the password via SMS)
- Remove unnecessary pages with [PDF Split](/en/split) before sharing
- Optimize file size with [PDF Compression](/en/compress) before sending
- Consider removing metadata before distributing to external parties

## Are Online Tools Secure?

Trusted platforms like PDFEdit receive your files over SSL/TLS encrypted connections, process them server-side, and automatically delete them after a set period. Your files are never shared with third parties or stored permanently.

## Layered Security Approach

For maximum protection, combine multiple security measures:

1. **Encrypt** the document with a strong password
2. **Add a watermark** to deter unauthorized copying
3. **Clean metadata** to remove hidden information
4. **Set permissions** to restrict printing and editing

## Conclusion

A layered approach to PDF security yields the best results. By combining encryption, watermarks, and metadata cleaning, you can comprehensively protect your sensitive documents. PDFEdit provides all these tools for free, making document security accessible to everyone.
